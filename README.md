Several exercise simulations for a computational physics course.

## Exercise 1
A few simple warmup problems to get everybody up to speed.
1. Simple matrix operations
2. Computing the Chebyshev polynomials using iteration.
3. Integer Overflow

## Exercise 2
1. Random walks in one dimension
2. Event-based simulation of an EPRB experiment. Simulate quantum behaviour without solving the Schrödinger equation.

## Exercise 3
Simulation of the Ising model of ferromagnetism for one and two dimensions using the Metropolis-Monte-Carlo algorithm. The two-dimensional Ising model shows phase transitions.

## Exercise 4
Solving the Newtonian equations of motion using different algorithms such as
* Simple Euler
* Symplectic Euler
* Velocity Verlet

## Exercise 5
Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism in one dimension using Yee's algorithm

## Exercise 6
Solving the diffusion equation using a product formula approach and comparing it to random walks.

## Exercise 7
Solver for the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation. Test case: Tunneling of a Gaussian wave packet through a tunnel barrier
